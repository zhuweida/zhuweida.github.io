<p>For this course our advisor Dr. Novocin broadened our horizons in many technical aspects.We have achieved many knowledge and polarized many technical skills. Our C and C++ skills have been improved significantly. We learned many secure skills for example memory management,linux file manipulation and permissions, gdb debugging,valgrind for memory leaks and so on. Most important harvests in this course are the projects which we have done. </p>

<p>For this project I made a website to grab the content of tweets and used Markov chaining algorithm to randomly edit the contents of it .For this project we used html,javascript,php,CSS in front end and python ,C++ in back-end.</p>

<p>We wrote a function which consumes three arguments width height number_of_mines and generates a Minesweeper board internally. The board is a rectangle with a cover over each square. We displayed this board to the user and prompt for a coordinate where they predict that no mine exists (format: x-coord y-coord 0-indexed). If they struck a mine then they lose (let them know). Otherwise uncover the selected square. </p>

<p>We built a website which is actually a secure asynchronous message platform supporting customer to login and register. Once they logged in they can read or write email. And all the email text and password which are stored in database are encrypted with hash values in order to protect customer information extreme confidential.(CSS,html,javascript,php,C++,sqlite3)</p>

<p>We not only did these projects in this course we also played a role as red team to detect the security loophole in other classmates' project which make us are more confident not only building software but also secure software. </p>
